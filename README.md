List of CRAN(Comprehensive R Archive Network): https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
CRAN, which stands for the Comprehensive R Archive Network, is the primary repository for R packages. It's essentially a network of servers that stores and distributes the source code, binaries, and documentation for the R programming language, including user-contributed packages. Think of it as an "app store" for R, where users can download and install packages to extend R's functionality. 

RStudio package manager provides a modern alternative: it works like a CRAN mirror, but it has a lot of additional functionality.
